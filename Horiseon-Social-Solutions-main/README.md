# Horiseon Social Solutions

## Description

I updated this site to be more accessible for everyone, including **Web Crawlers** by using semantic HTML to better comply with ADA & WCAG standards.  Mostly, I learned about new tags used to communicate these things, and cleaned up a lot of CSS accordingly!

## Table of Contents

README.md (this file!  Hooray, a recursive loop!)

index.html (the main landing page)

assets/style.css (the CSS stylesheet for the landing page)

assets/images/mockup.png                      (Criteria for Appearance)
