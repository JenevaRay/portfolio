# Jeneva Ray's Portfolio

## Description

I created this site using ![portfolio demo](./Assets/images/02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif) as inspiration, and used semantic HTML and CSS both from scratch to make the site responsive to multiple formats and to interaction with the end user.

## Table of Contents

README.md           (this file!  Hooray, a recursive loop!)

LICENSE             MIT license, because I own my own image of myself, and free images were edited/credited/used.

index.html              the main landing page

assets/css/reset.css    reset the stylesheet to something easily modifiable.

assets/css/style.css    the highly customized CSS stylesheet

assets/images/02-advanced-css-homework-demo.gif the gif that was the inspiration for this site.

assets/images/cropped*.png  generic images which came from pxfuel.com (royalty free).

assets/images/selfie.png    Me, Myself, and I.  Not three people.

assets/images/Horiseon-deployed.png     the hero image from my Horiseon Social Solutions demo site, used as a reference to - guess what?  the Horiseon Social Solutions demo site that is packaged as part of this site.

Horiseon-Social-Solutions-main  the (redeployed) site for the (github) https://github.com/JenevaRay/Horiseon-Social-Solutions demo site, redeployed internally (click on the image to go there).


## Installation
